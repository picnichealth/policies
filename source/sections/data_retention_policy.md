# Data Retention Policy

Despite not being a requirement within HIPAA, PicnicHealth understand and appreciates the importance of health data retention. Acting as a subcontractor, and at times a business associate, PicnicHealth is not directly responsible for health and medical records retention as set forth by each state. Despite this, PicnicHealth has created and implemented the following policy to make it easier for PicnicHealth Customers to support data retention laws.

## State Medical Record Laws

## Data Retention Policy

* Current PicnicHealth Customers have data stored by PicnicHealth as a part of the PicnicHealth Service.
* Once a Customer ceases to be a Customer, as defined below, the following steps are 
	1. Customer is sent a notice via email of change of standing, and given the option to reinstate account.
	2. If no response to notice in #1 above within 7 days, or if Customer responds they do not want to reinstate account, Customer is sent directions for how to download their data from PicnicHealth and/or to have PicnicHealth continue to store the data at a rate of $25/month for up to 100GB. If there is more than 100GB of data, PicnicHealth will work with Customer to determine storage costs.
	3. If Customer downloads data or does not respond to notices from PicnicHealth within 30 days, PicnicHealth removed data from PicnicHealth systems and Customer is sent notice of removal of data.
